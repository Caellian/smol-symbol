This crate provides the ability to create globally unique (per input value), human-readable
`Symbol`s at compile-time as well as at run-time, that are meant to be reminiscent of the
`Symbol` type in the Crystal programming language.

Where this crate differs is the alphabet and length of our `Symbol` is a bit more restrictive,
allowing us to encode the entire text of each `Symbol` as a `u128` internally. The only caveat
is we are limited to 25 characters of length and an alphabet consisting of lowercase a-z as
well as `_`. No other characters are permitted.

The `Symbol` type can be created at compile-time using the convenient `s!` macro, and can also
be created using the `TryFrom<AsRef<str>>` impl at runtime, though this is not as efficient as
doing this at compile-time using the `s!` macro.

The `Symbol` type can also be turned into a `String` via a convenient `Into<String>` impl.

We also provide the ability to define custom alphabets that use the more general `CustomSymbol`
type via a handy `custom_alphabet!` macro, allowing you to alter these restrictions directly
(smaller alphabet = larger max length for a symbol) and add support for other languages or less
restrictive character sets. The only invariant that can't be customized at the moment is
`CustomSymbol` will always use a `u128` as its backing data store.
